To start the site simply double-click the appropriate batch file.
This site requires that the python module 'Pillow' be installed via pip.
The 'Start with Pillow Install.bat' file will attempt to install Pillow and launch the server.
If that doesn't work (we suspect it may not due to permission restrictions on the lab machines),
then you will have to install it manually and run the server with the 'Start without Pillow Install.bat'.
In a realistic situation, the site would be set up in a production environment for the client and Pillow 
would already be installed, but since this situation isn't as it typically would be, if you can't get Pillow 
installed you can visit the site at: rhochmuth-dev.ddns.net:8000 (NO LONGER ACTIVE!)

For either of the batch files, the databased will be created properly and a browser will open up to the site automatically.
NOTE: There is a 15 second delay between clicking the batch file and the browser launching.  So don't be alarmed by it, it 
isn't 'frozen' it's just building the site.

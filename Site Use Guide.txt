Welcome to HealthNet!

This is a basic guide on the current use of our site.

Patient Registration:
1.) The first screen shown is the login screen.  Here you can login if you have an account.
2.) At first you won't have an account so click the register link at the bottom of the login box.
3.) Now enter your desired login credentials.  When finished, click the Register button.
4.) Now you should see the patient information forms.  Go through the forms and enter your information.
5.) After you've finished registration and have entered all of your information, you will be directed
	to the profile view.  Here you can see all of your information.
6.) From here you can use the sidebar to navigate to other areas of the site.

Checking the Site Logs:
For now the only way to access the logs is by manipulating the URL directly, this will be changed in the future.
1.) Append '/log' to the site base URL (ex. 127.0.0.1:8000/log)
2.) That will show a form to make log queries.  Fill in one or more fields to search for log events that match.
	NOTE: To view all log events with no filtering, simply click the submit button with no entered queries.

NOTE: This walk-through is very basic and will be expanded upon as development continues.
